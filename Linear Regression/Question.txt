You are given a dataset named “boston” (OA 4.2). This dataset contains information collected by the US Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, MA. The dataset is small, with only 506 cases. The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. (1978). Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5, 81–102. Here are the variables captured in this dataset:

CRIM – per capita crime rate by town
ZN – proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
INDUS – proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS – Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX – nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM – average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE – proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS – weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD – index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX – full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO – pupil-teacher ratio by town
B – 1000(Bk - 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town
LSTAT – % lower status of the population
MEDV – Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

Using appropriate correlation and regression tests, find which of the variables is the best predictor of NOX (nitric oxides concentration). For that model, provide the regression plot and equation.
